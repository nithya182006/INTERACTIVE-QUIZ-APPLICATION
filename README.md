 Here’s a **short paragraph** describing how you performed the task:

---

To create the interactive quiz app, I started by setting up a basic project structure with three files: `index.html` for the layout, `style.css` for styling, and `script.js` for the interactive functionality. In the HTML file, I designed a simple quiz interface that includes a question area, multiple choice buttons, and a “Next” button. Using CSS, I styled the app with a modern look, including a gradient background, button hover effects, and visual feedback for right and wrong answers. In JavaScript, I wrote logic to display questions one at a time, check the selected answer, and provide instant feedback by highlighting the correct or incorrect choice. Finally, I ran the app in a web browser to test its functionality and ensure smooth navigation through the quiz.
